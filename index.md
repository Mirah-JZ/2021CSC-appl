## Notes on 2021 CSC 

Disclaimer:
This is based on information on the 2021 application cycle (through UK, Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Chengdu).


### What's covered on CSC websites:
The overall process and stages of application are documented on CSC websites. These will usually be made public in mid January.

### What's NOT covered on CSC websites (or 木虫)
For candidates applying shortly after receiving a degree overseas.

1) Personal advice: apply to the CSC overseas in March before returning to China.
e.g.  Applying through the UK consulate:

2) If you had returned to China,  then the application to the CSC has to be supported with the nomination from a Chinese institution, normally your employer. 

You will have to produce evidence of employment. The employment status should be formal, not an internship nor on a probational basis. Evidence typically includes but is not restricted to, a copy of contract and latest 3+ months of matching social security payment records. Specific requirements may not be explicitly laid out on official websites, so, enquiry to local agencies is important. 

The employer will have to produce a reference form as well as something resembling a nomination letter. Details on format vary by province by year, this info is usually made public in February/ March.
